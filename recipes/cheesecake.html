    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat the over to <strong>350 degrees</strong>. Grease a 9 inch springform pan.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.</p>
